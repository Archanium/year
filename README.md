year
====

keep track what you've done in 2014, without ever leaving your terminal.

backed up with git, purely file based, stupid/simple/stumple

##[sa]usage

simple as:

```bash
year "today I've done amazing things"

#you can also specify a date
##the accepted time format is %m-%d-%Y
year "today I've done amazing things" --date 01-03-2014

#list things you have done this year
year list

#destroy all the informations about the illegal things you have done this year
year trim|delete|purge|fuckthepolice|reset
```

make 2014 the best year of your life with _year.sh_ (damn, i should make tv commercials)

(and no, i don't know how to type uppercase letters)
