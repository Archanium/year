year
====

keep track what you've done in 2014, without ever leaving your terminal.

git backup, purely file based.

##[sa]usage

simple as:

```bash
year "today I've done amazing things"

#you can also specify a date
##the accepted time format is %m-%d-%Y
year "today I've done amazing things" --date 01-03-2014
```

make 2014 the best year of your life with _year.sh_ (damn, i should make some  tv commercials)

(and no, i don't know how to type uppercase letters)
